# Build

Orchestrate the build pipeline in the following stages.

## Output contract

Every terminal path below — success or failure, at any stage — must end the response with `BUILD_RESULT: PASSED` or `BUILD_RESULT: FAILED` as the exact last line, so callers of this skill can parse the outcome reliably instead of inferring it from prose. Each stage below states which literal line to use when it terminates the pipeline.

## Stage 1 — Plan

Launch the `planner` subagent with the task passed as the skill argument. Wait for it to complete and capture the full plan it returns.

If the planner returns no plan or fails, stop, report the error, then end with `BUILD_RESULT: FAILED`. Do not proceed.

## Stage 2 — Implement

Launch the `coder` subagent with the plan from Stage 1 as its prompt. Wait for it to complete and capture the implementation report.

If the coder returns no implementation report or fails, stop, report the error, then end with `BUILD_RESULT: FAILED`. Do not proceed.

## Stage 3 — Test

Launch the `tester` subagent with the following as its prompt:

- The original task
- The plan from Stage 1
- The implementation report from Stage 2

Wait for it to complete and capture the findings report.

If the tester returns no findings report or fails, stop, report the error, then end with `BUILD_RESULT: FAILED`. Do not proceed.

## Stage 4 — Evaluate and decide

Track an attempt counter, starting at 1 for the implementation from Stage 2. Read the tester's findings report and count findings by severity.

**If the implementation passes** (zero CRITICAL, zero MAJOR, and 2 or fewer MINOR findings): the pipeline is complete. Return the tester's findings report to the user, surfacing any MINOR findings as a note, then end with `BUILD_RESULT: PASSED`.

**If the implementation does not pass** (at least one CRITICAL or MAJOR finding, or more than 2 MINOR findings):

- **If the attempt counter is below 3**: increment the counter, launch the `coder` subagent again with the original plan from Stage 1 (unmodified) and the tester's findings report from Stage 3 (unmodified), instructing it to amend the implementation to address all flagged findings while staying within the scope of the original plan. Then repeat Stage 3 (test) against the new implementation, and re-evaluate here at Stage 4.
- **If the attempt counter has reached 3** (i.e. the implementation has already been tried 3 times, including retries): stop the loop. Report to the user that the pipeline did not converge after 3 attempts, include the final tester findings report in full so the user can see what's still outstanding, then end with `BUILD_RESULT: FAILED`.
